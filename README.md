# Coffee.Read-Temperature
Arduino code to measure coffee roasting temperature using a thermocouple and MAX31855, and the Python script for Artisan roasting software to retrieve a temperature reading from it. This repository also includes a Python tool to test the temperature output for any errors by collecting sample sets and identifying outliers.
